# GC_Sandbar_Timelapse_Tool
A notebook walking through the process of creating time lapses from oblique sandbar imagery in Grand Canyon


Workflow completed using Jupyter notebook in an Anaconda Environment with Python 3.9 and OpenCV installed.

This workflow should allow a user to point to a directory and create a timelapse with all of the images in it (web res or full res)

Its recommended the if you utilize full-res you use the resize arguement and downscale images by 50%
